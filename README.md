# rust-KTANE-solver

*Because we needed another one of these*

A solver for KTANE written in rust. Currently only supports the module "The Button".
I will hopefully add more modules in the future.

To use, first [install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and then run:
```console
$ cargo run
```
